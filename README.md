# Hi there 👋 I'm Ilham Firmansyah
With more than a year of specialized programming experience, I have mastered technologies such as Spring
Boot, Quarkus, Express, SQL and NoSQL databases. I have proven my skills as a software engineer at one of
the IT consulting companies in Indonesia, where I honed my skills in software design, troubleshooting, and
implementation. My commitment to continuous learning, coupled with a solid foundation in algorithms and
system design, positions me as a results-oriented professional ready to provide innovative solutions to advance
your technology initiatives.
